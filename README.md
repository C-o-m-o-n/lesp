## Welcome to the LESP repository! üëã

LESP is a lightweight, efficient spelling proofreader written in Python. It's designed to be easy to use and lightweight, while still providing a decent result when checking for spelling errors. Resource consumption is kept to a minimum, and the program is designed to be as fast as possible.

## Features ‚ú®

- Lightweight and efficient
- Easy to use
- Fast
- Cross-platform
- No dependencies
- (Kind of) Customizable

## Installation üì•

Simply clone the repository and run the `demo.py` file to check it out. You don't need to install any additional libraries, so this is like plug-and-play. Just note that anything below Python 3.2 won't run this since old versions don't support `concurrent.futures`, which is used to speed up the process.

### Detailed installation instructions

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LyubomirT/lesp.git
```

2. Open the folder

```bash
cd lesp
```

3. Run the demo

```bash
python demo.py
```

## Usage üìñ

LESP is pretty easy to setup, and basic configuration are already pre-built. You can find them in `config` and `demo_config` (these are files, not folders!) and you can edit them to your liking. Note that these files are **required** for the program to run, so don't delete, move, or rename them.

### Basic usage

To use LESP, you need to import `is_correct` and `get_similar` from the `lesp` module. Then, you can use them like this:

```python
from lesp import is_correct, get_similar

clearlynotcorrect = is_correct("apgle") # False

if not clearlynotcorrect:
    print("Did you mean: " + get_similar("apgle")) # Did you mean: apple
```

Simple as that!

### Advanced usage

You can use a different wordlist by specifying it in the `config` file. Just note that the wordlist must be a `.txt` file, and it must be in the same folder as the file you want to run.

A wordlist must be structured with each word on a new line, like this:

```
apple
banana
orange
```

After you've done with putting a good wordlist in the directory, specify it in the `config` file like this:

```
wordlist="my_wordlist.txt"
```

You can customize the process of getting similar words as well. Configuration will be provided as arguments to the `get_similar` function. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import get_similar

similar_words = get_similar("apgle", similarity_rate=0.5, chunks=4, upto=3)

print(similar_words)
```

In the code above, we're getting similar words to `apgle` with a similarity rate of 0.5, splitting the wordlist into 4 chunks, and returning up to 3 similar words. 

A similarity rate of `0.5` means that the words returned will be at least 50% similar to the word we're checking. The higher the similarity rate, the more precise the results will be, but generally there will be less words. Myself I would recommend to keep the similarity rate at `0.5`, but you can experiment with it and see what works best for you.

The `chunks` argument specifies how many chunks the wordlist will be split into. This is useful if you have a large wordlist and you want to speed up the process. The higher the number, the faster the process will be, but the more memory/CPU it will consume. For example, when trying to scan `wordlist.txt` with 1500 chunks, the process takes about 0.5 seconds on my machine, but it consumes about 1.5 GB of RAM and 44% of one of the CPU cores. If you have a large wordlist.

The `upto` argument specifies how many similar words will be returned. If you set it to `3`, then the function will return up to 3 similar words. If you set it to `1`, then it will return up to 1 similar word. But, whatever amount you select, the output will still be a list. If you set it to `0`, then the function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Get similarity score

Even if this function isn't really supposed to be a feature, you can still use it if you want to. It's pretty simple to use, just import `get_similarity_score` from the `lesp` module and use it like this:

```python
from lesp import get_similarity_score

score = get_similarity_score("apple", "apgle") # 0.8

print(score)
```

The function will return a float between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the words are completely different, and 1 means that the words are exactly the same.

### Backup

If you're concerned about losing your wordlist, you can use the `backup` function to backup your wordlist. It will create a file in the path you specify, and it will write the wordlist in it. Note that the file will be overwritten if it already exists. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import backup

backup("my_wordlist_backup.txt") # Leave empty to use default path
```

### Restore

If you've backed up your wordlist, you can restore it using the `restore` function. It will read the file you specify and it will overwrite the current wordlist with the one in the file. Note that the file must exist, otherwise the function will raise a `FileNotFoundError`. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import restore

restore(True, "my_wordlist_backup.txt") # Leave empty to use default path
```

True here stands for `overridecurrent`, which lets you choose whether you want the wordlist file to be overwritten or not. If you set it to `False`, then the function will leave your current wordlist file untouched, and will just modify the wordlist variable in the current session. If you set it to `True`, then the function will overwrite the wordlist file with the one in the backup file along with the wordlist variable in the current session.

### Extend wordlist

This is useful if the user usually writes about a specific, non-general topic. For example, if the user is a programmer, you can extend the wordlist with programming-related words if one is not found in the wordlist already. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import is_correct, extend_wordlist, backup, get_similar

if not is_correct("reactjs") and get_similar("reactjs") is None:
    confirm = input("reactjs is not in the wordlist. Would you like to add it? (y/n) ")
    if confirm.lower() == "y":
        backup()
        extend_wordlist("reactjs")
        print("reactjs added to wordlist.")
    else:
        pass
```

You can also extend the wordlist with multiple words at once by passing a list or a tuple to the function. Like this:

```python
from lesp import extend_wordlist

words = ["reactjs", "vuejs", "angularjs"]

extend_wordlist(words)
```

### Remove from wordlist

An opposite of the `extend_wordlist` function, this function removes a word from the wordlist. Note that this function will raise a `ValueError` if the word is not in the wordlist. Also note that this function will not remove the word from the wordlist permanently, it will only remove it for the current session. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import remove_from_wordlist

word = "reactjs"
remove_from_wordlist(word)
```

If you want to remove multiple words at once, you can pass a list or a tuple to the function. Like this:

```python
from lesp import remove_from_wordlist

words = ["reactjs", "vuejs", "angularjs"]

remove_from_wordlist(words)
```

### Stacking

This function lets you stack two wordlist files together, so you can have a bigger wordlist out of two combined. The function will take two arguments, the source file and the destination file. The source file is the file that will be stacked on top of the destination file. Here's an example:

```python
from lesp import stack

stack("wordlist.txt", "my_wordlist.txt")
```

### Merge delete

This function lets you delete all words from the destination file that are in the source file. For example, if you have a wordlist with the following words:

```
apple
banana
orange
```

And you have another wordlist with the following words:

```
apple
banana
raspberry
```

Then, if you use the `merge_delete` function, the destination file will be modified to look like this:

```
orange
raspberry
```

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```python
from lesp import merge_delete

merge_delete("wordlist.txt", "my_wordlist.txt")

with open("my_wordlist.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

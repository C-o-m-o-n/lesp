## Making Changes

### Coding Standards

Please follow the existing coding standards used in the project. This includes code formatting, naming conventions, and commenting.

### AI-Generated Code

While using AI to assist you while programming is okay, Pull Requests with the whole change made by AI will probably be rejected. Please use AI to assist you, not to do the whole work for you. If the Pull Request is made by AI, please add a comment that you used AI to assist you.

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for meaningful and consistent commit messages.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes are well-tested. Add new test cases where necessary and make sure existing tests pass.

## Pull Request Process

### Opening a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Open a pull request on the main repository.

### Code Review

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Address any feedback and make additional changes if necessary.

### Merging a Pull Request

Once your pull request has been approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch. Afterward, your contribution will be part of the next release.
